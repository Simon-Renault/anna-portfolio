title: "Little bets between friends \U0001F91D"
intro: Why can't we separate from our smartphones and devices? Why do we hide behind
  our screen when we feel alone? We are more and more afraid of those moments of emptiness
  and silence. We are living in an increasingly connected world where Infobesity is
  a fact. So we feel compelled to respond at the minute, to be informed quickly, or
  to be aware of the information that comes to us as soon as possible.

## Researches

### Why this topic?

We spend on average 4 hours and 48 minutes a day in France on the Internet including 1h22 on social media. These figures on screen time alarmed me. I reflected on the use of digital and I found that more than half of the time spent on the internet (outside of work time) was a waste of time for me. It was enough for me to ask myself the following question: was this moment useful to me? The answer has often been negative. I'm also very frustrated every day to not manage to get by without my cell phone, and to find that I'm dependent on it.

### Context

44% of the world's population actively use social networks (70% in Northern America, 60% in Europe and 64% in Eastern Asia). We spend around the world on average 3 hours and 15 minutes per day on our screens. I then asked myself the following question: could not this time spent on the screens be used for something more profitable?

##### ILLUSTRATION BY BURNT TOAST CREATIVE

### What Iâ€™ve learned from it

#### DIGITAL AMNESIA

A clearly observed delegation of our memory to our digital devices. A transition that is not entirely negative but must be measured: we are able to think for ourselves.

#### MOMENT OF EMPTINESS

In a world where infobesity is more and more present, moments of emptiness are more rare, often seen as a waste of time. In the same way as sleep, the moments when we do nothing are perceived as useless.

#### SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS

Solutions exist but not necessarily effective because it's quickly abandoned by disinterestedness (not attractive, not amusing, do not present benefits)

## Ideation

### Positioning

How to propose a personalized experience in order to reduce its digital use in the long term?

### Concept

#### THE IDEA

A gamified service offering challenges between friends to push ourselves to reduce our screen time and to be free from our digital devices, while understanding the benefits through the visualization of our data (by quantified-self concept)

#### NO MONEY

Challenging ourselves with others is always more motivating, especially as competitiveness pushes us to give the best of ourselves. Unlike bets, it's not about money. The idea is to spend more time with our relatives rather than using the app to earn a second salary. And it's still more fun to get paid for a meal with the friend with whom you played the bet.

#### A PROGRAM TO BUILD

The user during his first entry into the application is brought to answer several questions in order to target his problem. He should identify the applications on which he considers spending too much time, but also which activities he would like to devote more time. He also has to reflect on his objectives.

## Production

### Architecture

##### APP ARCHITECTURE

The aim of this first step was to build a complete architecture of the app. I've divided the app into 4 parts: challenges, program, challenge store and friends.

Information to highlight is data control, which the user could find in the program part of the app. So he can discover his data, analyzed, sorted and bring into a visual and positive way (highlight progress, congratulate the user)

Challenge store allows the user to discover the different challenges he can launch with a friend.

Friends part notifies friend's activities (when they achieve a goal) but also to visualize what he owed to his friends, or what he won, from his achievements or his defeats from challenges.

Finally, the challenges part concerns the current challenges. Some challenges require a manual data input, as the time spent on an activity that the user had decided to develop over the next few months. So he is therefore notified via this screen what he needs to record for the day. We also find the results of the challenge's scores at the end of the day

### Wireframes

##### WIREFRAMES

Once the app components were fixed, I started a wireframing process. The aim was to begin to organize components and information.

### Screen Design

  
![home screen](https://anna-rabeony.com/images/projects/ux%20cases/betfriends/Screendesign/screendesign.png)

#### ONBOARDING

For the onboarding step at the beginning of the experience, we ask the user to select his main problem (social media, lack of free time...), apps on which he spends to much time, activities on which he wants to spend more time, and finally to choose two different goals. A bottom sheet show selected components.

##### ONBOARDING"

#### PROGRAM

Consumption data and habits are described in a funny way. User can edit his program (apps and activities) because his needs can evolve.

##### FRIEND PART

#### CHALLENGES

Every day, new advice suggests alternatives or solutions try new habits.

##### PARTIE "CHALLENGES"

#### CHALLENGE STORE

When the user launches a new challenge, he can select the friend with whom he wants to start, and so choose what he wants to win if he succeeds.

##### NEW CHALLENGE PROCESS

## What's next?

Being still on iteration step for the production of finalized interfaces, I then plan to submit its interfaces to user tests to identify ergonomic problems, but also to have subjective feelings (visual design). Following his tests, I could redesign and work again on these screens to make an animated prototype.

To be continued...
