title: Tomorrow - Life is too short to lose time
intro: In an article published in 2018, Head of Localization Salvatore “Salvo” Giammarresi
  explained the importance of prioritizing globalization efforts at Airbnb. Now, fresh
  off the heels of a major localization milestone, we’re revisiting the topic, asking
  Salvo and Globalization Design Lead Taido Nakajima to fill us in on the tight cross-functional
  partnership that recently allowed Airbnb to launch 31 new languages across web,
  iOS, Android, and mobile web, for a total of 62 supported languages.
