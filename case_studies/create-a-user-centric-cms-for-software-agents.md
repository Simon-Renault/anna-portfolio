title: Happy List - Become independent from screens
intro: In an article published in 2018, Head of Localization Salvatore “Salvo” Giammarresi
  explained the importance of prioritizing globalization efforts at Airbnb. Now, fresh
  off the heels of a major localization milestone, we’re revisiting the topic, asking
  Salvo and Globalization Design Lead Taido Nakajima to fill us in on the tight cross-functional
  partnership that recently allowed Airbnb to launch 31 new languages across web,
  iOS, Android, and mobile web, for a total of 62 supported languages.

An example of a goal

Let's take a look at this goal example. I want to become comfortable in cooking. I will first define the goal: become independent from food deliveries, cook more often, and eat healthier. Then, I will set a list of milestones. I want to make this a habit, so let's set a reminder to goal every weekday in the evening and twice every weekend in the morning. I had the impression that I don't have enough time, so I will set how much time I need to set up this new goal. Once I've entered how much time I need, the application will suggest apps I spend too much time on during those moments when I need free time to set up my new goal. I can select apps that I want to spend less time on, and here we go!
