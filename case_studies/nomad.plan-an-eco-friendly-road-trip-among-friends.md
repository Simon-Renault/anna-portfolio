title: Nomad. Plan an eco-friendly road-trip among friends
intro: I love to travel and I'll always love it. If you ask me what is the thing I
  would love to do for the rest of my life, it will definitively be traveling. But
  we realize more and more that traveling costs a lot for the planet, and it's not
  for sure the best ecological activity to do. Stop it? No way! As a designer, I usually
  say that there's always a solution. Nomad is an app to help travellers to organize
  an eco-friendly and sustainable road-trip.
